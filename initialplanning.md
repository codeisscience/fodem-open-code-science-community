# FOSDEM2020 Devroom plans
## open(code + science + community)

### Organisers
- Yo Yehudi, Emmy Tsang, Michael Crusoe, Mateusz Kuzak

### Topics

- How to organise an inclusive event
- Working open 101
- GitHub as a collaborative platform (not even for code!)
- Mental health
- Mentoring
- How to organise Study Group / Hacky hour



### Audience
- RSEs
- Researchers who develop software/tools, who identify as researchers: There are researchers who develop software, so we are giving them a reason to go to a open-source software conference
- The themes are not exclusive to science

### Selling point
- Broadening the FOSDEM community and bringing in researchers (who usually wouldn’t be there), so that the FOSDEM community can benefit from more diverse thoughts
- Try to give stage to people who aren’t always highly represented.
