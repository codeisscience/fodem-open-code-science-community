# FOSDEM Devroom Proposal: open(code + science + community)

**to be submitted by September 20**
[https://submission.fosdem.org/submission/devroom](https://submission.fosdem.org/submission/devroom)

## Project details 
* Title of devroom
    * open(code + science + community)
* Elaborate description of proposed devroom (including possible topics)
    * open(code + science + community) will be a devroom oriented specifically towards scientists and researchers who work in open software domains. We intend to run a range of sessions, starting from the basics - how and why one might wish to work open-source in science and research - and touch upon various different aspects of working openly in academia. Topics include "working open 101", How to make your project welcome to the diverse community, How to organise an inclusive event, GitHub as a collaborative platform (not even for code!), Mental health, Mentoring, and How to organise a Study Group / Hacky hour. 
* Why does it fit FOSDEM?
    * A core tenet of the open source movement is that innovation and useful tools should be available to everyone, not only the select few, or those who can afford it. Similarly, scientific and research software should be available openly so the public can benefit, not just shareholders. FOSDEM will allow us to bring the scientific and research community together with other open practitioners to share knowledge and skillsets. 
* Preferred slot: (half day / full day / both days)
    * Full Day
